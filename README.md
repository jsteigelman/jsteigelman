# Hi, I'm Joey 👋

Hi, I’m Joey! I’m a developer based in New York City.  
- 👩‍💼 In a past life I worked in the corporate art world, where I gained experience leading cross-functional teams and communicating ideas between engineers and business stackeholders. 
- 👩‍💻 I recently had the opportunity to attend the Recurse Center, where I focused on using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and building full-stack applications.
- 👍 I have a keen eye for detail, design, and user usability, and love the satisfaction that comes with driving projects from concept to delivery!
