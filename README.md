# Hi, I'm Joey ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
Iâ€™m an artist-turned-developer, having realized that building products is more enjoyable than building sculpture! I recently had the opportunity to attend the Recurse Center, where I focused on using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and building full-stack applications. I have a keen eye for detail, design, and user usability, and love the satisfaction that comes with driving projects from concept to delivery. When Iâ€™m not coding I can be found reading, cooking, or learning laser holography!
